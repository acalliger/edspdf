# Classifiers

We developed EDS-PDF with modularity in mind. To that end, you can choose between multiple classification methods.

| `dummy-classifier` | Dummy classifier, for testing purposes. Classifies every bloc to `body` |
| `random.v1`        | To sow chaos                                                            |
