# Trained Pipeline with Scikit-Learn

In this section, we'll see how we can use Scikit-Learn to train a machine-learning based
classifier to get better performances.

!!! warning

    Scikit-Learn is ill-equipped to deal with text data. As such,
    it is not the best candidate to provide an effective classification
    method. However, it can still perform quite well and remains a good place
    to start tinkering with the inner workings of EDS-PDF.
