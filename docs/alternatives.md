# Alternatives & Comparison

EDS-PDF was developed to propose a more modular and extendable approach to PDF extraction than [PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/),
the legacy implementation at APHP's clinical data warehouse.

We also experimented with [GROBID](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)[@GROBID], which was not a good fit our use-case.
In particular, keeping line order proved difficult with GROBID.
